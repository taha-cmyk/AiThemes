# Theme Editor Application

This project is a Theme Editor application built with React. It allows users to switch between multiple themes, toggle between light and dark modes, reset themes to default, and export the current theme as a CSS file.

## Features

- **Theme Switching**: Switch between multiple themes dynamically.
- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: Toggle between light and dark modes.
- **Theme Reset**: Reset the current theme to its default values.
- **Export Theme**: Export the current theme as a CSS file.
- **Live Preview**: Preview UI elements with the current theme in real-time.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn




### Switching Themes

1. Use the theme dropdown to switch between available themes.
2. The application will update the UI elements to reflect the selected theme.

### Toggling Light/Dark Mode

1. Use the toggle switch to switch between light and dark modes.
2. The background and text colors will update accordingly.

### Resetting Themes

1. Click the "Reset Theme" button to reset the current theme to its default values.

### Exporting Theme as CSS

1. Click the "Export as CSS" button to download the current theme as a CSS file.
2. The CSS file will contain CSS variables for both light and dark modes.

### Including Exported CSS

1. Save the exported CSS file (e.g., `theme.css`) in your project directory, typically in a `styles` or `assets` folder.
2. Include the CSS file in your main CSS or directly in your React component.

#### Example: Including CSS in a React Project

**Option 1: Import in Main CSS File**

```css
/* src/styles/global.css */
@import url('/theme.css');

/* Other global styles */
```

**Option 2: Import Directly in React Component**

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import React from "react";
import ThemeEditor from "./components/ThemeEditor";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/theme.css" />
      <ThemeEditor />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Using the CSS Variables in Your Components

Once the CSS file is included, you can use the CSS variables defined in `theme.css` within your components.

**Example with Styled Components**

```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

const ThemedButton = styled.button`
  background-color: var(--light-primary);
  color: var(--light-onPrimary);
  border: none;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  cursor: pointer;
  border-radius: 5px;
`;

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <ThemedButton>Click Me</ThemedButton>;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

**Example with Inline Styles**

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <button
      style={{
        backgroundColor: "var(--light-primary)",
        color: "var(--light-onPrimary)",
        border: "none",
        padding: "10px 20px",
        cursor: "pointer",
        borderRadius: "5px",
      }}
    >
      Click Me
    </button>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
